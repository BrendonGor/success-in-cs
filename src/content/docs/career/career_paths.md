## Resources for Career Paths
- https://roadmap.sh/ has a list of roles and skill maps for each role.
- Scroll through Lex Fridman podcast and listen to anyone who seems of interest (Neri Oxman, Chris Latter, Manolis kellisâ€¦). He has had a lot of interesting tech people on his podcast and they all have interesting stories.
- If there is still a masters or Phd for it, it is still a possible technical area (although most positions may be in academia). This is a lagging indicator.
