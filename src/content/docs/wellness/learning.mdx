## Free Stuff
As a student you get access to free stuff both from the universitiy and from other enterprises.
### Readings
#### 'News'
As a student you get free access to certain publications: 
1. [**THE NEW YORK TIMES**](https://attheu.utah.edu/announcements/access-the-new-york-times-online/)
2. [**THE WALL STREET JOURNAL**](https://attheu.utah.edu/announcements/wall-street-journal-for-students-and-faculty/)
:::tip
While these are the two publications I know students get a free account for, you may search [**here**](https://databases.tools.lib.utah.edu/) to see all publications provided by the library. There are many journals and news sources for which we have their articles (through some content aggregator) but not direct access to the publication via an account.

 I perfer reading the Economist and the New Yorker. You have access to pieces from these publications through the library, however you cannot get a free account.

#### Books
The library has many free physical, digital, and audio books. You can also request the library to get books. Supposidly, they have plenty of money.
For **free audio books** check out Libby, Hoopla, and Librivox.
#### Blogs
Try to find some blogs you like to read. They are often shorter than books and of higher quality than news articles.
