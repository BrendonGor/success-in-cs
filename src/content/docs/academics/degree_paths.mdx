## The Advertising
> "Students in the Kahlert School of Computing can pursue degrees in computer science, data science, software development, computer engineering
> - **Computer Science** encompasses the theory and discipline of solving computational problems. Computer scientists analyze and engineer the software, algorithms, computer systems, and theories that continue to advance the modern technological world. They work in a broad range of areas including artificial intelligence, security, graphics, robotics, operating systems, networking and communication.
> - **Data Science** focuses on the practice and theory of extracting useful knowledge, results, and understanding from raw data. Data scientists typically work with consumers and producers of data in order to analyze, manage, and augment large data sets or work in industries that require automated forms of decision making and analysis.
> - **Software Development** is the study of the principles, tools, and techniques for developing modern software. Software developers create the web, mobile, and desktop applications that we use every day. They typically work as full stack developers, writing and maintaining the secure front end and back end code that turns a specification into a real-world, functioning system.
> - **Computer Engineering** emphasizes the physical and hardware aspects of computing. Computer engineers design computer circuits, processors, and the electronic systems and devices that computers control. Computer engineers also design and develop the software to analyze and control sophisticated devices and machines." [source](https://www.cs.utah.edu/academics/undergraduate/)
### My Take
The descriptions above are apt descriptions of the fields of CS, SE, and DS. They are not, however, great at distinguishing the degree paths from one another. Degrees aim to prepare the student for the descriptions above.
#### CS is Still King?
The CS degree teaches you the theoretical and technical underpinnings. If you understand what is taught you will come out with two advantages:
1. Ability to understand and solve edge case problems. I venture this will become increasingly important becuase of 3 factors:
    1.  automation taking over typical tasks
    2.  increased complexity of systems resulting in more edge cases
    3.  engineers invariably skipping on fundamentals as the space of knowledge to learn grows
2. Ability to understand and implement new technologies. If you understand the fundamentals you can understand the new technologies that are built on top of them.
With the amount of electives the CS degree offers, you should be able to get good enough course experience in whichever field or subdomain interests you. 
:::note
Some universities only offer a CS degree. While others go as far as offering a CS+X degree, where X is a field like agriculture, physics, or math.

#### The benefit of SE
The SE degree is arguably more practical. You will probably write and read more code over your college tenure. You will also probably work on more group projects. These are good things. The SE degree moves away from the theoretical and towards the practical. It is more akin to the ethos of trade school.
#### DS?
You will be better at describing data and predicting data. If your goal is industry work, you will be most valuable if you either:
- deeply understand the math and statistics
- are able to implement algorithms and models at scale with best practices
It is not clear to me that DS makes you good enough at either of these to be invaluable.

   I think students are best off majoring in CS and using their electives to take courses in the fields and topics they are interested in.
   Use the SE and DS electives and requirments to help choose your electives.
