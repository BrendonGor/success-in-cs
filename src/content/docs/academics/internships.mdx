<p>Getting an internship becomes substantially easier and more likely if you have some 'in'. This can be through a professor, a friend, or a family member. Make connections and use them.</p>

### How to get an internship?
If you know someone who works at a company you're interested in and values your skills, ask them to refer you. However, most students **do not** have this luxury.
In this case these are your options:
1. **Go to the career fairs**. They will all be on Handshake. Come prepared with physical and digital copies of your resume as well as answers to common interview questions. The more hands you get your resume into, the better. The longer you talk to recruiters, the better. The more QR codes you scan, the better. 
And most **important**, the more you follow up, the better. If you go to the career fair, talk to the recruiters, give them your resume, apply in person if you can, and follow up, your odds will go up 10x.

I got a Freshman Spring internship and Sophmore summer internship at the career fair. I've also gotten multiple interviews and offers from the career fair. To put into perspective, I wen't to the CS and Engineering career fairs and got ~4 offers after ~6 interviews. After applying to over 100 positions online I got 2 interviews and 1 offer.
I know KSoC students with similar experiences. Online job postings get hundreds of applications.
