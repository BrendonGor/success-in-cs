- Go to research day (or your universities equivalent) and talk to the professors/students about their research

### How to get involved
1. **Find a professor** that is doing research in an area that interests you and talk to them (go to their office hours) or send a high quality email.
2. Look at the open opportunities posted on [**here**](https://our.utah.edu/find-a-research-opportunity/). The lab does not have to be directly in the School of Computing. Your skills are invaluable to many labs on campus.

:::Tip
Get involved. A lab will probably be the easiest and best way to get exposure to real world engineering and teamwork. It is also a great way to boost your resume and make a little money.
Do not be afraid to speak with a professor. Just be professional and respectful in person and in email.
